<p align="justify">As I started with my first few weeks of ICT-9 1st Quarter, I was not that overwhelmed at the new topics, since for me, they were very easy to understand. Throughout the quarter, the quizzes and worksheets were not that difficult, however, the hands-on activities were proven to be quite difficult, as I found it hard to get used to the overall coding process paired with the new lessons and features I was learning about. I feel like if I had just put in a little more effort and had been more careful, I would have also done well in the hands-on activities and performance tasks. As I approach 2nd Quarter, I realize that I can improve my study habits to yield better results from my grades not just from this particular subject, but from the other subjects as well. I really look forward to expanding my knowledge in this particular field of learning in the future through the many topics, activities, and tasks to come.
